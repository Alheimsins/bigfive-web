# Requested features

- Add age and gender input boxes
- Optional facebook login
- UX Improvements needed
- Overall styling improvement needed
- Recommend removing number of questions from homepage, 10 minutes to take test seems fine, but 120 questions is daunting :heavy_check_mark:
- Add multi language support on the home page :heavy_check_mark:
- Option to choose between bar and circle graph on results page :heavy_check_mark:
- Option to show results on a STEN scale (I would assume that you have enough data to establish the population mean)
- It is sometime difficult to get the correct meaning of the question in the language you are attempting the assessment, so provide an option to view the same question in an alternate language before answering.
