# Requested features

- Add age and gender input boxes
- Optional facebook login
- UX Improvements needed
- Overall styling improvement needed
- Recommend removing number of questions from homepage, 10 minutes to take test seems fine, but 120 questions is daunting :heavy_check_mark:
- Add multi language support on the home page :heavy_check_mark:
- Option to choose between bar and circle graph on results page :heavy_check_mark:
- Option to show results on a STEN scale (I would assume that you have enough data to establish the population mean)
